    <p>Node.js frameworks are collections of libraries and tools that build on top of the Node.js runtime environment. They provide a structured way to develop applications, including features like routing, middleware, and templating engines. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server-side, making it ideal for building scalable and high-performance web applications. </p>
